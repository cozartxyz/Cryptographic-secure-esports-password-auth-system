# 🔐 Advanced Authentication System

An advanced, secure, and scalable authentication system built with **Python** and designed for production-ready applications.  

## ✨ Features

- **Username & Email Encryption** – Securely encrypts user identifiers before storing them.
- **Password Hashing** – Uses industry-standard hashing (e.g., bcrypt/argon2) with salt for strong password security.
- **Database Support** – Multi-user support with a structured and scalable database.
- **IP Address Logging** – Tracks login attempts and suspicious activity per user/session.
- **Password Reset** – Secure password reset flow with time-limited tokens.
- **Email Authentication** – Verifies user identity via email confirmation links.
- **Human Verification (CAPTCHA)** – Prevents automated signups and brute-force attacks.
- **Rate Limiting** – Mitigates abuse by limiting requests per IP/user.
- **Geolocation Verification** – Detects unusual login locations and can trigger alerts.
- **Malicious Activity Detection** – Monitors suspicious patterns (e.g., repeated failed logins) and blocks attackers.
